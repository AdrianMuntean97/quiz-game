## Testing

- I have tested the game and all it's functions work properly.
- I have been testing the game on 3 different devices(a desktop and 2 mobiles), and the game works properly on all 3 of them.
- I have confirmed that the text is easy to read on both desktop and mobile devices and that the page is responsive using the dev tool.
- I have tested the code using all 3 validators for HTML CSS and JavaScript resulting in no errors. <br><br>
